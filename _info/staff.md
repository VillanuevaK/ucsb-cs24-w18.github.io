    <i> "Hi everyone! I'm Nidhi, a first year Masters Student in the CS department. This will be the first time I'm TAing CS24 and am excited to help you better understand computer programming with C++. The topics we’re planning to cover in CS24, like Object Oriented Programming and some data structures will help you begin building exciting projects. I built most of my first projects in C++ and would be happy to help you do the same. I'm into interdisciplinary research, so if that's something you might be interested in, I'd be happy to share my experiences. In my spare time, I enjoy destroying my sleep cycle with TV shows and weight-lifting. I'm always open to discussing anything you might need help with, like choosing classes, getting involved in research labs or just about anything, feel free to reach out to me on Piazza" </i>

  <i> "Hey, my name is Jack, and I’ve been looking forward to TAing this class for the whole year! I’m a master’s student in the Computer Science BS/MS program, where you get a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in five years (highly recommended). In the past, I’ve mentored in CS56 and CS190I, and last quarter I TAed CS184. As I said, I’ve wanted to TA an introductory CS class for quite a while, and I can’t wait to help guide you through the more advanced elements of C++ as well as your first complex data structures. Linked lists and binary search trees had something of a magical quality for me when I first learned them three years ago, and I hope you will have a similarly enthralling experience in this course" </i>

    <i> " I'm super glad I can be one of your tutors for CS24 this quarter. In CS24 you'll start learning how to apply all the problem solving skills you've learned in the past, and get a quick intro to more complex data structures. It may be a bit scary at first (we've all been there!), but overtime you'll learn a lot and come to love CS even more! This quarter, you'll see me running around at SB Hacks IV and SASE West Regional Conference, so don't be afraid to say hi!! If you want to learn more about getting involved in UCSB club organizations and landing super cool internships for the summer, feel free to talk to me during class or when you see me in the library (I don’t mind getting distracted haha). I've gone through it all, and I don't mind helping out where I can~ :) Aside from UCSB and CS, I love to explore/travel, hike, and spend as much time outside as I can (can't beat the Cali sun).

  <i> "Hi everyone, I’m so excited to be one of your tutors for this upcoming quarter! I know this class can be daunting at times, and I’d love to help you with any concept that you might be unclear about, figure out how to approach the PAs, or even give you career or college advice (classes to take, internship advice, things unrelated to academics, etc). This class will set the foundation for your classes in the future so it’s very important to understand the material, and even if you need to ask the same question multiple times to really drive a point home, I never want you to feel afraid to ask me anything! If you see me around campus, feel free to say hi or reach out to me on Piazza. Hope you have a great quarter! :)" </i>
