<p> Hi everyone! I'm Nidhi, a first year Masters Student in the CS department. This will be the first time I'm TAing CS24 and am excited to help you better understand computer programming with C++. The topics weâ€™re planning to cover in CS24, like Object Oriented Programming and some data structures will help you begin building exciting projects. I built most of my first projects in C++ and would be happy to help you do the same. I'm into interdisciplinary research, so if that's something you might be interested in, I'd be happy to share my experiences. In my spare time, I enjoy destroying my sleep cycle with TV shows and weight-lifting. I'm always open to discussing anything you might need help with, like choosing classes, getting involved in research labs or just about anything, feel free to reach out to me at nidhi_h@cs.ucsb.edu </p>
